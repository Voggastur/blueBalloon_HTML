#My very first web page

Welcome!

This repository has been used in my studies in the Code Institute Full Stack Development Course.
Only HTML and CSS has been used in this repo, and most pages contain single css animations

Index.html is the only finished project in here and it showcases the technologies I will learn trough my course

I really enjoyed learning css with transitions. The transition-interactive.html shows my first experiments with transitions and animations, which have been made responsive on hover to change into various transforms.
