#My very first web page

Welcome!

This project is a result of me following instructions to the point.
It consists of three pages which lists the technologies I will use throughout my course.
For this webpage however I have only used HTML5 and CSS3.

README Summary tips:

What the project does,
what technologies have been used,
what features you'd like to add,
also give credit for any code that's been taken from other places such as libraries or code from StackOverflow.
