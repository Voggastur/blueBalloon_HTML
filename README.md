#My very first web page

Welcome!

This repository has been used for my practical study and challenges in the Code Institute Full Stack Development Course

Index is the only finished project in here and it lists the technologies I will learn trough my course with links to wikipages.

Through practical experience, I enjoyed doing css with transitions the most. The transition-interactive.html shows my first experiments with transitions and animations, which have been made responsive to various transforms.
