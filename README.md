#My very first web page

Welcome!

This repository has been used for challenges on the Code Institute Full Stack Development Course

Index is the only coherent finished project in here and it stacks up the technologies I will learn trough my course with two links to additional pages and technologies.

Through practical experience, I enjoyed doing css for transition.html the most. It shows my first experiments with transitions and animations, which are also responsive to hover for various alternating transitions.
